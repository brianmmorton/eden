This is a boilerplate for using best practices for a highly scalable application. It uses GraphQL,
TypeGraphQL, Relay, React, and Typescript. For database, it uses supabase, which you can swap for
others and implement custom authentication and other solutions, but was used here for ease of implementation.

# Getting Started

Clone the repo, and start by copying apps/api/.env.example to apps/api/.env.
You'll need to fill in those variables.
Create a supabase url to connect your project to.
